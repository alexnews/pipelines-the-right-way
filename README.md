## 📘 **Book Introduction — *Pipelines the Right Way***

Every data engineer has built a messy pipeline at least once.
It worked — until it didn’t.
Jobs failed quietly, tests broke, logs went missing, and “just one script” turned into an untraceable web of dependencies.

This book is about doing it differently.
It’s about building **pipelines that last** — ones that are observable, testable, and maintainable.
No magic. No corporate jargon. Just the clear, repeatable patterns that make your data systems behave.

**Pipelines the Right Way** is written for working engineers — people who already ship code and want to raise their standards without drowning in theory.
Each chapter shows a real project that you can run locally.
You’ll move from a simple CSV example to real APIs, partitioned assets, schedules, and sensors — all with Dagster, an open-source data orchestrator built for the modern stack.

By the end, you’ll understand not just how to use Dagster, but how to think in terms of **assets**, **lineage**, **idempotency**, and **observability** — the core ideas behind reliable data engineering.

This isn’t a marketing book or a quick tutorial.
It’s a hands-on guide written by an engineer who has broken plenty of pipelines — and learned how to keep them running.

Welcome to *Pipelines the Right Way*.
Let’s build something that doesn’t fall apart.
